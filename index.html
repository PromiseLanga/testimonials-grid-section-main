            <p id="p-white">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br> were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I <br> honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</p>
            <p><q>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a<br> transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for<br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12<br> weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've<br> successfully switched careers, wrking as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. </q></p>

            <p><q>I started as a total newbie with<br> virtually no coding skills. I now work<br> as a mobile engineer at a big<br> company. This was one of the best<br> investments I've made in myself. </q></p>

            <p id="p-white">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp<br> themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from<br> their experiences was easy.</p>
            <p><q>The stuff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The<br> progrma gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present<br> myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the<br> personal attention you need from an incredibly community of smart and amazing people. </q></p>

            <p id="p-grey">Such a life-changing<br> experience. Highly<br> recommended!</p>
            <p><q>Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve<br> never written a line of code. I needed<br> some structure from professionals<br> who can help me learn programming<br> step by step. I was encouraged to<br> enroll by a former student of theirs<br> who can only say wonderful things<br> about the program. The entire<br> curriculum and staff did not<br> disappoint. They were very hands-on<br> and I never had to wait long for<br> assistance. The agile team project, in<br> particular, was outstanding. It took<br> my learning to the next level in a way<br> that no tutorial could ever have. In<br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br> interviews as an example of my<br> developent experience. It certainly<br> helped me land a job as a full-stack<br> developer after receiving multiple<br> offers. 100% recommend! </q></p>
